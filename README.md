1.Download and Explore the Dataset:
Download the dataset from the provided Kaggle link.
Explore the dataset to understand its structure, features, and any preprocessing required.

2.Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values, if any.
Encode categorical variables, if any.
Scale the numerical features if they are on different scales.

3.Feature Selection:
Select the relevant features for clustering. In this case, it might include purchase history, such as total spending, frequency of purchases, etc.

4.K-means Clustering:
Initialize the K-means algorithm with the desired number of clusters (K).
Fit the K-means algorithm to the selected features.
Obtain cluster labels for each data point.

5.Cluster Analysis:
Analyze the characteristics of each cluster to understand the customer segments.
Visualize the clusters if possible to gain insights into their distribution and separation.

6.Interpretation:
Interpret the results and provide actionable insights based on the customer segments identified.
